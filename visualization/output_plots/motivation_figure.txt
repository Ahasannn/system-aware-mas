Figure 1: Resource underutilization in system-load-unaware multi-agent LLM routing. (a) Queue depth shows severe load imbalance—requests accumulate in small models while large models remain underutilized, with 17x disparity at high load. (b) Response latency reveals that although small models appear efficient at low load, they become significantly slower than large models as load increases. The shaded region represents avoidable latency where large models could serve requests faster but remain idle. (c) At low system load, large models are idle 67% of the time (vs 29% for small models), representing capacity that could be leveraged for extended reasoning to improve output quality.
