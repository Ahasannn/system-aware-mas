# Optional: route different models to different OpenAI-compatible base URLs.
# - Set as a JSON object string; or
# - Set as a path to a JSON file on disk.
#
# Example:
# MODEL_BASE_URLS = '{"Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct":"http://127.0.0.1:8001/v1"}'
#
# Tip (local testing): you can also put the mapping in `config_test.json` and
# MasRouter will auto-detect it without needing to export env vars.
